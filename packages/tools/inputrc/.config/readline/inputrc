# GNU Readline Configuration
# This file configures the behavior of the readline library used by bash, python, and other programs

# Make Tab autocomplete regardless of filename case
set completion-ignore-case on

# List all matches in case multiple possible completions are possible
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Use the text that has already been typed as the prefix for searching through
# commands (basically more intelligent Up/Down behavior)

# Do not autocomplete hidden files unless the pattern explicitly begins with a dot
set match-hidden-files off

# If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all
set completion-query-items 200

# Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does
set visible-stats on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
